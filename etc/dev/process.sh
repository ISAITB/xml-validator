# Bash script to facilitate the testing of the validator as a command-line tool for a given domain.
#
# To use this script:
# 1. Build the project so that the JAR module's JAR is created.
# 2. Make a copy of this script.
# 3. Adapt in the copy the script's configuration variables (see script configuration block below) to match your environment.
# 4. Execute this script from a bash shell. The script also requires the "zip" and "unzip" tools to be defined.
#
# Script configuration - START
#
# The path to the default JAR file for the command line tool (as produced given the maven build).

TMP_FOLDER="/mnt/d/_dev/xml/offline/tmp"
# The folder in which the resulting JAR file will be placed.

RESOURCE_FOLDER="/mnt/d/git/itb/docker/validator-xml-any"
# The name of the domain within the resource root.
